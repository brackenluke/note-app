# Note Taker with Express.js

## Description
This application is used for creating and saving notes. I learned a lot during the process about creating routes, and how to access the backend.

## How to use
Make sure you have node installed. Open the project. Find the "note-app" folder and open it in your terminal. Type "npm i" then "node server.js" to start the server. Naviagte to your browser and type "[localhost](http://localhost:3001/)"
